                    Millions of years of evolution and still we are debating on whether we should be allowed to carry arms or not?
                    With all major cities in India filled beyond their capacities and road rage incidents happening all the time,
                    give everyone some arms and let's teach those Biology kids a living example of Darwin's theory… “Survival of
                    the fittest”. 
                    <br><br>
                    But on a serious note, though.
                    <br><br>
                    The need for personal possession of arms by common people generally arises due to lack of efficient functioning
                    or lack of resources to safeguard any nation's citizens. Citizens need arms in sparsely populated areas or in the
                    wilds for their personal protection, where police can't be guarding them 24*7, 365 days of the year.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the situation is completely different in countries like India, where we have densely populated cities
                    and policing is efficient and sufficient. Giving people the autonomy of walking into a supermart and purchasing
                    all sorts of violent weapons and equipment, would only make it difficult for the state to carry on with its
                    administration.
                    <br><br>
                    Like if I were to compare it with something, I would take the example of the arsenal development of the countries.
                    Earlier, when only a few countries had large arsenals, times were peacer and calmer. There was no fear of war and
                    bloodshed. Cut to present times, every third country in the world possesses an arsenal capable well enough to solve
                    the issues of OverPopulation and World Hung……, I mean death, yes. Billions of people can die if some madman becomes
                    a tyrant ruler in one of these countries.
                    <br><br>
                    Let's take the example of North Korea for instance. Being surrounded by Nuclear Superpowers, the country invested
                    heavily in its arsenal development and adds around 5 nuclear warheads to its arsenal every year. Even during the
                    time of Pandemic, the country's interests lay more in military development rather than investing in issues like
                    famine and plague, which it has been facing for a very long time now. This shows how blind one gets in peer pressure
                    and superiority complexes.
                    <br><br>
                    But, yeah. There are some plus points, too. First and foremost, it will greatly affect Pakistan's economy. Dawood
                    will come, na, to get duty-free bombs. Secondly, employment. Just imagine the employment it would generate in order
                    to cater to millions of people wanting to buy guns and ammunition.. And, these are just the direct effects.
                    Indirect effects will include a boost in the economy, rise in living standards and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    But, we must not forget all this would come at the cost of what the US faces today, the terror from its own people.
                    Because, not only are we arming ourselves for protection, but also those, from whom we would then want to be
                    protected.
                    <br><br>
                    So, I think we should just resort to Pepper Spray and Twitter as of now, for self defence and to show our anger.
                    And, let's keep the roads and streets free from any probable violence or disharmony. That was my TedTalk on whether
                    being armed should be a right or not. And I believe in solving problems using means other than violence and terror.
